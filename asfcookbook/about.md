# Three years as an Apache Member

My first involvement with the Apache projects was back to 2018 on the [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) project.

With the contribution around Flink's high-availability service that is backed by [Apache Curator](https://curator.apache.org/) and [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), I was invited as a committer of Flink in 2019, and a PMC member of Curator in 2020.

In 2022, [Ning Jiang](https://willemjiang.github.io/about/) invited me to become a founding member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

In March 2022, I noticed that [Kvrocks was seeking for entering the ASF Incubator](https://lists.apache.org/thread/bdtmvbmvzrgjd1kj7mdrp9tkqrhg3d31) to develop its community better. According to [the policy of Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/policy/incubation.html#joining_the_ipmc), I requested to be an Incubator PMC member and started acting as a mentor of the Kvrocks podling.

[Kvrocks has graduated](https://lists.apache.org/thread/hbl8fsy5pw0k2k6prx62r1v1r7n9psjr) in June 2023. And I gained a lot of experience for running a podling during its incubation. Here are all podlings I mentored:

| Project                                            | Start          | Graduate  | Role                |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|

| [Apache Fury](https://fury.apache.org)             | December 2023  |           | Champion and Mentor |

Besides, I participate in maintaining a few of Apache projects:

This cookbook documents:

1. How to participate in an Apache project
2. How to develop an Apache project community
3. My understanding of [The Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/)

You can use it as an index or an unofficial explanation of ASF documents and policies. My personal interpretation and experience may help you succeed in the ASF. **However, please never use this cookbook as an official reference in conversations.**
